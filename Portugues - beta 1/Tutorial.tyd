Tutorial
    {
    SHARED1                 "To start developing software, designers need to piece together a design document. This document describes how the software should be developed and structured, to make sure everyone is on the same page.
	
The design phase is split up into iterations. Each iteration increases the potential end quality and decreases the speed and amount of bugs in your project. There are 2 ways to tackle the design phase:
	•You can finish 1 iteration and handle any issues in the development phase
	•You can finish all iterations and have less issues in the development phase
	
The first method is very effective, but makes it hard to estimate how long development will take, however the second method is guaranteed to extend the design phase exponentially.

Press {H:continue} to advance the tutorial."
    SHARED2                 "When doing a review you have to choose how many reviews you want. The more reviews you have, the better accuracy you get.
			
You also have to decide who you want to carry out the review, which affects the final price.

Finally, you have to decide which parts of the software to review. If you have already gotten good scores from a past review, you can save time and money by skipping those areas for the current review.

Pres {H:OK} when you are ready to continue."
    SHARED3                 "Reviews will pour in as time goes on. You can finish it prematurely if you want, but if you want high accuracy, you should wait until all reviews are in.

Note that reviews will be based on a version of the project that existed when you first clicked review, so any subsequent changes wont be accounted for.
			
Click the {H:End} button on the review when the progress bar has filled up."
    SHARED4                 "If the review score is unsatisfactory, you can click the iterate button to pause development and let your designers rework the design document. This will tighten up any loose ends, but also set back your project progress a bit.

If you are happy with your score, just close the review window and continue development."
    SHARED5                 "Pressing {KeyBind:MultipleSelect} on objects, rooms or employees will allow you to select several at once, you can then press {KeyBind:ContextMenu} anywhere to see the context menu. You can hold {KeyBind:SweepSelect} down to select objects of the same type quickly or press {KeyBind:NormalSelection} and drag to select everything within a rectangle.

Try selecting at least 2 things in the game."
    SHARED6                 "Let's put some furniture in your room.

Build a new table by clicking on the {H:Furnish} button or searching for {H:table}."
    SHARED7                 "Now add a chair. Chairs can only be added to tables.

Note that some furniture, like chairs and tables, can be replaced with alternate versions after they have been placed. You can use the context menu to easily replace a lot of furniture at once, by selecting all furniture of the same type in the selected rooms for example."
    SHARED8                 "Finally add a computer. When you add a computer click and hold where you want to add it and drag the mouse in the direction you want it to face, finally, release the mouse button to place it.

Computers have to sit on top of a table and face a chair."
    SHARED9                 "When you put tables next to each other they will be grouped together if they don't have anything on top of them. Tables that are grouped together can be used for meetings. To see which tables are grouped, just select one table and its group will be highlighted in blue.

It's important you control the noise levels in your working environment, try enabling the audio overlay to see what furniture is making noise."
    SHARED10                "Your founder does not get hungry, lonely, stressed, need bathroom breaks or get annoyed in general, but when you hire new employees they will. So make sure to add at least one vending machine, a radiator, a ventilator and a separate bathroom before you hire new employees.

Toggle the audio overlay to advance."
    SHARED11                "Now, let's assign the room to a team, employees from other teams may then not use it or even pass through it.

Right click your new room and choose {H:Switch team}, which resembles a circle with arrows. A window will appear, click on {H:Core} to assign the room to the Core team.

Remember to assign employees to a team as well. You can do this either by pressing {KeyBind:ContextMenu} on an employee and choosing {H:Switch team}, from the employees window or directly in the hiring window."
    SHARED12                "Start the tutorial by pressing the {H:Develop software} button to bring up the design document."
    SHARED13                "Continue by going to the first page of the advanced design document."
    SHARED14                "Welcome to the design document, the heart of Software Inc. This is where you decide what kind of software you want to make.

Start by picking a software type.

Click continue to to advance the tutorial."
    SHARED15                "If applicable, you can pick a software category. Each category for a software type has different development times, popularity, audience retention, features and its own target audience."
    SHARED16                "Then pick a name. You can either write one yourself or press the \"Name:\" button to have it generated."
    SHARED17                "You can also pick a price. If you leave the price field alone, the best price will be picked based on the software and features you've chosen. You can click the Price button to reset the price."
    SHARED18                "Let's look at the features you can pick for your product. Each feature takes time to develop and satisfies different markets.

Software is divided up into specializations, like 2D, 3D, System, etc. Each specialization is shown as a container in the feature panel and each container has a list of extra features you can add. The extra features require that your employees have the right amount of \"stars\" for the specialization they belong to.

Features that are highlighted in red are unavailable because you don't have any employees in your selected development teams that have the required amount of stars."
    SHARED19                "1 star features are simple features that help satisfy submarkets to a lesser degree

2 star features are far more effective at satisfying their target audiences than 1 star features, as you'll get more value for the time spent developing them

3 star features don't satisfy your target audience, but instead modify your software in some way"
    SHARED20                "As you may have noticed, each main feature has a tech level associated with it. Tech levels can be researched by you or other companies from year to year.

Sticking to the latest tech level will increase your target audience satisfaction and the marketability of your product, but increase development time and possible research and license costs associated with its development.

It's worth noting that the maximum tech level is limited by any tools needed during development."
    SHARED21                "You can make your software a sequel to a product you made previously or which you bought from another company. You do this by clicking the {H:Original IP} button and selecting a product.

Making a sequel will give a marketing boost and change your fans' expectations depending on the success of its predecessors.

Features that were implemented in the predecessor product will be highlighted in orange in the feature panel, as these features will be developed faster than normal."
    SHARED22                "Your product can depend on other software types. As an example, you will need a 2D Editor to make a game with 2D graphics, otherwise your artists wouldn't be able to create the graphical assets needed.
			
Furthermore, most software also needs to run on one or more operating systems. It would be wise to pick popular operating systems to support, as they will limit your audience size. But beware that each operating system you decide to support will extend development time.

You can port your software to other operating systems after it has been released, if you so desire.

Move to the next page when you're ready."
    SHARED23                "The submarket triangle let's you decide how your marketing and design efforts will be weighted, to target a section of users in the market.

You could either decide which markets you want to target and pick features that will satisfy those markets, or pick the features you want in your product and balance the markets to fit those features.

The 3 bars in the bottom will show you how well your chosen features satisfy each market and how much they require, based on how you balanced the triangle.

Only 1 page left to go!"
    SHARED24                "If you're worried about how to pay your developers, how many physical copies you'll have to order or how much effort to put into your marketing campaign, you can sign up with a publisher and they will handle these details, if you agree to pay royalties off your product's profits."
    SHARED25                "Before you finish, make sure you inspect the information in this box. This outlines everything you need to develop this product.
			
Take special note of the {H:Expected interest} percent, as adding more features after it hits 100% will only increase development time and not your sales.

Having more than the suggested amount of employees on the development teams will result in diminishing returns, so you're paying more in salaries, but getting a smaller and smaller speed increase in return."
    SHARED26                "After you've went through the phases of development and you're ready to release your product, remember to see if any popular products have just been released in the same software category as yours.

You can also check out the {H:Event calendar} to avoid upcoming releases from your competitors and make sure a large company won't outshine your product.

Timing is everything when you're just starting out!"
    SHARED27                "To transport boxes around your building you need {H:conveyor belts}.

{H:Conveyor belts} allow you to route boxes through walls and onto pallets or directly to the outside for couriers to pick up, by placing {H:Garage ports}.

You can direct boxes from different places to the same destination by placing conveyor belts perpendicular to each other. Or you can split boxes in different directions by placing {H:Conveyor Splitters}. Make sure you leave room on your conveyor belts for boxes to pass, as machines won't be able to push out boxes if the conveyor belt in front of them is blocked."
    SHARED28                "{H:Pallets} can be used as storage, to avoid a box pileup, or as a pickup point for {H:couriers}.

Place {H:drop points} on {H:conveyor belts} adjacent to {H:pallets} to drop boxes off when the conveyor belts are obstructed and place {H:pickup points} to move boxes from pallets to a conveyor belt when the path is clear.
		
Exit {H:build mode} when you are ready."
    SHARED29                "In the staff window you can either hire {H:couriers} to come once every day and pick up boxes or call a courier to pick up as many boxes as possible immediately. Calling couriers is a lot more expensive and should be reserved for emergencies.
		
When you are ready, open the {H:distribution window} to see how you can run your own digital distribution store."
    SHARED30                "You'll also need to pick a lead designer to come up with ideas for your project. The game will already have chosen the most suitable employee, based on the assigned design teams."
    ADDONS1                 "You can develop new add-ons at any time by opening {H:Your releases} window and selecting a product with add-ons available or by opening the detail window for a product and clicking one of its add-on tabs.

Try starting development of an add-on now to continue the tutorial."
    ADDONS2                 "An {H:Add-on} is a product you can develop to be sold as an extension of an existing product.

Click {H:Continue} to have a look at the features you can pick for an add-on."
    ADDONS3                 "Features for add-ons work like features for regular products, but some have the option of increasing their potential.

The features you can add will depend on the parent product category and features. Features should be selected in such a way that they appeal to the same target market as the product they are made for.

You can find add-ons for other products by looking for products in the product window that have a non-zero balance in the {H:Add-on profit} column.

Try and see if you can find such a product now."
    ADDONS4                 "Now click the relevant add-on tab and open the details of an add-on to see its details."
    ADDONS5                 "Developing add-ons can be a good way to gain some extra income from popular products or bringing back old customers for subscription-based products.

Add-ons made for hardware are peripherals, and some can be mandatory for development of the main product and some can even be sold several times to the same customer, such as joysticks for consoles."
    ADVANCEDDESIGNDOCUMENT3 "The first page of the advanced design document resembles the simple design document, but with an added {H:Framework} panel.

You can use or create a framework when developing software. Frameworks speed up development, but lock down the maximum tech levels of your features.

Using a framework made by another company will require you pay a license fee from your profits.

If you decide to create a new framework, it will extend development slightly, but the new framework can be licensed out to other companies to make some extra money on the side."
    ADVANCEDDESIGNDOCUMENT4 "The advanced design document has multiple pages. Let's move on to page 2 to continue."
    ADVANCEDDESIGNDOCUMENT7 "This is the summary page. Here you can look over the final details of your project, decide on which design and development teams to use, and whether you want a {H:Publisher}. Publishers will help fund your project, handle marketing and physical distribution for a cut of your profits.

Click the develop button when you're ready to begin development."
    ALPHAWORK1              "You need to reach the implementation phase of development before the tutorial can continue"
    ALPHAWORK2              "Your project has now been promoted to implementation.

The implementation phase has two stages:
	•{H:Alpha}: in which developers and artists create the product according to the design specifications and requirements.
	•{H:Beta}: in which bugs are uncovered by your programmers and hopefully fixed before the final release."
    ALPHAWORK3              "You will see the progress bar fill as your employees work on the project and you can hover over the task to get a detailed breakdown of progress on each area of the implementation.
		
Progress tells nothing of the actual quality of the project, however. To get an idea of how good your employees' work is, you need to do a peer review. Start by pressing the review button."
    ALPHAWORK7              "Make sure you do a press release during the implementation phase, as you hopefully did during the design phase, unless you signed with a publisher.

During the implementation phase you also have the option to send out a press build, so the press can try your software. Press builds require no work on your part, but make sure you have good ratings in your peer reviews and some followers before you send one out.

The tutorial will continue once you send out a press build. Take all the time you need."
    ALPHAWORK8              "Press the Promote button to move on to the beta phase when you are ready."
    ALPHAWORK9              "The beta phase is theoretically endless, but you'll have to release your project at some point, especially if you've already announced a release date.

It's a good idea to fix as many bugs as possible, as buggy products will lead to refunds, but don't aim to fix every possible bug in your product. When your product is released you'll be able to fix more bugs, as your customers get in contact with your support team.

It's important to note that the amount of bugs an employee can fix depends on the most skilled programmer on their team. So your employees might not be able to fix all bugs and one team might stop fixing bugs while a second team carries on."
    ALPHAWORK10             "Press the release button when you're ready.
		
When you release your product you'll have to buy or print physical copies of it to sell. Later on, online software distribution will become more popular, but it is very important to have physical copies of your product before and during the 90s.
		
You can either print physical copies yourself or order some for immediate distribution at a higher price. The game will remind you of this when you release a product."
    BENEFITS1               "Start by opening the benefit window"
    BENEFITS2               "Employee benefits will passively increase employee satisfaction for all your employees, which can be very helpful if you want to lower their salaries or make sure they don't just quit when they get bored.

Some employee benefits can have a huge and immediate financial impact, while others might result in large satisfaction increases without having any immediate consequences.

You can safely play with the sliders and see their impact since changes aren't put in effect until you hit Apply.

Press continue to advance the tutorial."
    BENEFITS3               "If you check the checkbox next to a benefit and hit Apply, any employee with custom benefits will have it reset to the company default.
		
You can change benefits for employees individually in the employee overview window. Try opening it now, select one or more employees and click \"Change benefits\"."
    BENEFITS4               "To override a company benefit for individual employees, you need to check the checkbox next to the benefit."
    BUILDMODE1              "Start by entering {H:Build mode} by clicking the Build-button."
    BUILDMODE2              "The game is always paused in build mode.

Let's start by building a room. You have two choices for how you want to build a room.

Click on the {H:Rectangle rooms} button in the build panel to build a simple rectangle room or click the {H:Free angle rooms} button to build rooms in any shape you want, one wall at a time.

You can also use the {H:Free angle rooms} option to split rooms into two separate rooms, by simply building a wall through an existing room."
    BUILDMODE3              "Now click somewhere inside the area you own, which has a grid, and then click somewhere else to finish your new room. Keep an eye on the cost while moving the cursor."
    BUILDMODE4              "You might have noticed that you were limited to the grid when you built your room. You can change the grid and building angles if you want, by moving the grid gizmo to a wall or piece of furniture. This might come in handy if you want to build tables along a diagonal wall for example.

If you don't like how your room looks, you can use the undo button or {KeyBind:Undo} to undo your changes.

Click Continue when you are ready."
    BUILDMODE5              "You can move up and down floors by pressing {KeyBind:FloorUp} and {KeyBind:FloorDown}.

Now let's add windows and doors. You can either select a category or search for {H:window} or {H:door} in the build panel."
    BUILDMODE6              "Notice how the room lights up when you add windows, make sure to add enough so that your employees can see.

You can inspect lighting, environment, temperature and noise conditions by clicking on and selecting the room."
    BUILDMODE14             "You can also change the color of your rooms and furniture.

Try changing the color of your room by pressing {KeyBind:ContextMenu} on it and then click the {H:Room colors} button that resembles a brush."
    BUILDMODE15             "You can change the color of multiple things at once and the color window will suggest colors that are currently in use.

If you like the style you have given a room, you can save it by clicking {H:Save style} in the context menu for rooms, and {H:Set as default style} for furniture.

Click Apply when you are ready or close the window if you want to cancel your changes."
    BUILDMODE16             "You can merge rooms by using the {H:Destroy wall} tool, or by selecting the rooms you want to merge and then clicking the {H:Merge rooms} option from the context menu.
			
You can also create curvy wall sections using the {H:Curve tool} and clicking on a wall that does not have anything on it and dragging the mouse out.

Click Continue when you are ready to continue."
    BUILDMODE17             "When you no longer feel like you have enough space for your buildings, you can buy new plot areas by going to plot mode.

When you are ready to continue, exit build mode."
    BUILDMODE18             "When you are ready, open the employees window to start managing your employees."
    CONTRACTS1              "Start by opening the contract window."
    CONTRACTS2              "This is a list of available contracts. New contracts will be added as older ones are completed.

Contracts have an upfront payment you will receive for accepting the work, and a bigger payment for completing it. You complete a contract by delivering a product with the requested progress and quality.

Try selecting a contract in the list now."
    CONTRACTS3              "The final payout will be subtracted from, for not completing the contract, for not completing it on time and for any unfixed bugs.

Not living up to the clients quality expectations will impact your business reputation, but not your payout.

Browse the contracts now and accept one that sounds good to you."
    CONTRACTS5              "Until an employee actually starts working on the contract, the deadline will not count down.

The tutorial will continue once you move to the next phase of development."
    CONTRACTS6              "When the progressbar reaches the blue line you have lived up to the contract's progress requirements. However, you still need to meet their quality requirements, if you want to increase your business reputation and receive better contracts.

Make sure you do a client review before you move on to the bug fixing stage, to make sure you meet their quality requirements.

The tutorial will continue once you start a review."
    CONTRACTS10             "When you are ready, let's move on to the bug fixing stage.

It's impossible to know exactly how many bugs a piece of software has, so just try to fix as many as you can before time runs out.

Finish your contract work to end the tutorial."
    CUSTOMMAP1              "This tutorial assumes you've already tried build mode and will focus on how the map editor differs.
		
Click Continue if you're ready to advance."
    CUSTOMMAP2              "The map editor gives you the ability to make a building that you'll be able to lease into when you relocate or make a new company. The map editor does not have the ability to edit normal {H:for sale} buildings.

In the map editor, you have an unlimited supply of money and the ability to place environment objects. Try opening the environment tab now."
    CUSTOMMAP3              "You can hover over the different types of environment objects to get more details.

Another important aspect of rentable buildings is that you can provide some amenities for the tenant and you have to provide heating and cooling.
Make sure you place enough heating and cooling for the entire building. The tenant will not be able to interact with any furniture you place in the map editor.

Try building a room now."
    CUSTOMMAP4              "When you select your room and open the context menu, you'll notice a couple of new options, namely the ability to group rooms, mark them for renting and mark them as player owned rooms.

When you group rooms together, they can only be leased as one single unit. Cloning rooms will carry over the same grouping style, so you can build a layout and quickly duplicate it.

There is a data overlay which allows you to see how rooms have been marked. Enable it now to end the tutorial."

You can toggle body types multiple times to randomize your founder's look."
    CUSTOMIZATION5          "You can use these buttons to choose an aspect of your founder's appearance that you want to change.
	
You can change the shape of the face and eyebrows by clicking the first button, the rest of the buttons allow you to change clothes, accessories and colors."

You can click on unlocked traits to toggle them on and off."
    CUSTOMIZATION7          "Here you can pick your founder's skill points which will affect the performance of your founder.

Skills are balanced and the maximum amount of skill you can assign to begin with depends on the difficulty you choose."
    CUSTOMIZATIONCREATIVITY "Above your founder's skills is their creativity, which affects the quality of the ideas they come up with when designing a product.

Increasing your founder's creativity will lower their maximum skill level and add demands.

This is not very important early on and is probably best left where it is for your first game."
    CUSTOMIZATION8          "You can change your employees specialization points by clicking the highlighted stars down here.
			
Specialization levels control which tasks your employee can complete. Remember to check the other roles by using the dropdown.

Clicking the {H:Random} button will pick random specialization levels for the points you have left.

You can further educate and train your founder to gain skill and specializations in the game."
    NewCustomTraitTut2      "You can add up to 4 founders, but only 1 represents you and the rest will require a share of the company.

You will have to pay dividends of any profit to other share holders, so each extra founder will reduce your profit margin."

    CUSTOMIZATION10         "You can enable any mods here, which will be bound to the game forever.

You won't be able to enable or disable mods after your game has started, as they fundamentally alter how the game is played, but you can share your save game with others, without having to install the mods again."
    CUSTOMIZATION11         "Pick how much money you want to start with. You start with {StartingFunds} by default, any additional funds will be taken as loans.

Note that you need at least {StartingPlot} if you would rather purchase an empty plot, than lease rooms in a building."
    CUSTOMIZATION12         "You can change what year you want to start in here.
		
Starting later will give you the full power of modern tech and digital distribution, but your competitors will be more established."
    CUSTOMIZATION13         "Difficulty can be changed at any point in the game by going to the options menu.

Difficulty controls how easy it is to break into the market."
    CUSTOMIZATION14         "You can pick how many days you want per month.

1 month lasts for 1 day by default. The game was made with this pace in mind and it is therefore the recommended setting.

If you feel the game is going too fast or you want a couple of days to earn money between having to pay bills, you can increase this setting. Be aware that everything will move slower to match the setting you pick and you can't change it later on."
    CUSTOMIZATION15         "Click the Pick map button to pick your starting environment"
    CUSTOMIZATION16         "Here you can see a list of buildings you can buy outright or lease your way into. Next to each picture you can see whether a building is \"For rent\" or \"For sale\".

Note that the \"Building area\" for buildings you can lease into defines the maximum area you can lease as you expand your company."
    CUSTOMIZATION17         "You can use these buttons to pick whether you want to lease or buy an empty plot.

Construction is very expensive, so it is recommended that you start off leasing, but note that renting is a lot more expensive in the long run.

You can relocate your company any time you want during gameplay."
    DESIGNDOCUMENT11        "You can use or create a framework when developing software. Frameworks speed up development, but lock down the maximum tech levels of your features.

The game's choices might not be optimal, but you can safely start development at this point.

If you want to dive deeper into dependencies, frameworks and market targeting, you can switch to the advanced version of the design document by clicking {H:Advanced}, otherwise just click {H:Develop}."
    STAFF1                  "Begin by opening the staff window."
    STAFF2                  "This is the staff window. At the top you will see a list of your currently employed staff, whether permanent or temporary."
    STAFF3                  "With the buttons under {H:Permanent} you can hire staff permanently to clean, fix your furniture, etc. You can see their salary by hovering over the buttons. They will show up once a day until you dismiss them.

You can change their working hours using the buttons in the list."
    STAFF4                  "With the buttons under {H:Temporary} you can hire staff temporarily. They will stay until their job is done or until you dismiss them. Hovering over the buttons will show you their terms.

Press {H:Finish} to end the tutorial."
    STOCKS1                 "Start by opening your company detail window to view your stocks."
    STOCKS2                 "In the upper right corner of the company window, there's panel that allows you to sell shares in your company. Your company's value depends on how well your company is doing selling services and products, which determines how much of your company you can sell.

The first time you sell shares is called in {H:Initial Public Offering}, and all your money and the money you are raising will be separated into approximately {Currency:100} shares, which will be distributed among yourself and your investors.

Below this panel you will see a list of stocks you can buy and sell, depending on whether the company is {H:Publicly listed}, i.e. whether they are selling any shares at all.

Try opening another company's detail window, to see how many stocks they have. You can check the {H:Listed} column in the company window, to see how many percent of a company is up for sale."
    STOCKS3                 "Owning share in a company will earn you {H:Dividends}, which means you will get a percentage of the company's profits each month, depending on how much of the company you own. Note that you also have to pay dividends to your shareholders.

If you own more than {H:10%} of a company, you get to use their research before anyone else and if you own more than {H:25%} you don't have to pay royalties when using this company's tools, operating systems, frameworks or patents. Again, this also works the other way.

When you own more than {H:50%} of a company, you have a chance to buy them out. Buying a company out allows you to take over all their assets or make them a subsidiary. Subsidiaries will continue to operate as normal, but you can control their releases and ask them to do certain tasks for you.

If another company owns more than 50% of your company, they might start a {H:Hostile takeover}, which gives you 6 months to get them below 25% before your company is dissolved.

When a company goes bankrupt, all its assets will be distributed among its majority shareholders."
    SUBSIDIARY1             "To begin the tutorial, make sure you have a subsidiary and have their company detail window open."
    SUBSIDIARY2             "You control subsidiaries mainly in the company detail window.
		
You can use the slider to withdraw and deposit money, just like your savings account. Withdrawing all money from a subsidiary will close down the company, giving you all their assets.

The detail window also gives you an overview of their planned releases and the ability to cancel them.

Press Continue when you're ready."
    SUBSIDIARY3             "Developing takes up resources for a subsidiary, if you want them to work on specific tasks, or you want to control their release schedule, you can disable their autonomy, to make sure they don't spend time doing other things.
		
You can only assign projects that the subsidiary normally develops, so pay attention to their past and future releases. Try opening the design document and picking the software type they normally work on."
    SUBSIDIARY4             "Some tasks can be assigned to subsidiaries as well. This is expensive and takes up a lot of the subsidiary's resources. Keep an eye out for the company option when you are selecting teams for a task.
		
End the tutorial when you are ready"
    SUPPORTWORK1            "Before the support tutorial can continue, you need to have a product released and start support for it.

You can open the {H:Your releases} window and start support from there, if you have any products."
    SUPPORTWORK2            "When you release a new piece of software it will spawn a support work item. Through this work item you will receive support tickets from your customers, assuming you have any.

Support for a product never ends by itself, so you'll have to end it when you think support isn't necessary anymore. Keep an eye on the active user count to help guide you."
    SUPPORTWORK3            "Support tickets should be answered as quickly as possible to avoid consumer backlash and a loss of market recognition.
			
An employee's {H:Service} skill determines how quickly they can answer support tickets and having at least one star in the {H:Support} specialization will allow them to report bugs.

As bugs get verified by supporters, you'll want to fix them by releasing updates, which you can do by clicking the {H:Update} button on the task or from {H:Your releases}."
    TEAMMANAGEMENT1         "Begin by opening the team window."
    TEAMMANAGEMENT2         "In this window you can manage and create teams.

    TEAMMANAGEMENT3         "When you select one or more teams in the list you can see the average skill and counts of each specialization level of all employees in the selected teams.
		
You can change your teams' arrival and departure times by typing your desired hours in the left input fields with one or more teams selected."
    TEAMMANAGEMENT4         "You can set when vacation starts for your teams and how wide vacations should be spread. A vacation range of 2 means the vacation of all employees on a team will be split in 2 over 2 months, so you'll always have at least half of the employees at work.

You can enable crunch on a team to force your employees to work faster at the cost of their well-being."
    TEAMMANAGEMENT5         "To get an overview of your teams role assignments you can click the {H:Manage roles} button.
			
You can also set {H:Secondary tasks} for each team. Employees will only work on secondary tasks if they have no assigned primary task, which by default is every task."
    TEMPERATUREREGULATION1  "Start by entering {H:Build mode} by clicking the Build-button."
    TEMPERATUREREGULATION2  "Offices and reception areas need to have some temperature regulation to make sure employees and guests are comfortable in their environment.

Rooms can be heated and cooled in two ways: Either on a room-by-room basis or using a distributed system of pipes and vents.

To regulate the temperature in small offices, you can place down {H: Small Heaters, Ceiling Fans, Electric Radiators and AC Units}, which will immediately start changing the temperature in a room. Regulating the temperature in this way requires a lot of maintenance and will quickly drive up expenses in larger buildings.

Click {H:Continue} to hear about the distributed solution."
    TEMPERATUREREGULATION3  "You can use {H:Central Heating} and {H:Roof ACs} to distribute hot and cold air throughout a building using {H:Radiators} and {H:Ventilation} in each room. Since Radiators and Ventilation don't require maintenance, it will heavily reduce the workload for your staff.

When you've placed a central temperature unit, you can select it and click on the {H:Auto-buy temperature outputs} in the bottom left corner to place ventilation and radiators in offices and reception areas automatically."
    UPDATES1                "Start by launching an update of one of your existing products"
    UPDATES2                "Updating a product can entail patching any bugs that have been verified by your support team and/or increasing a product's tech levels to attract new customers or hold on to existing customers.

There are no limits to how often you update your software. You can release daily patches if you want.

Click on the {H:Update} button when you are ready to go."
